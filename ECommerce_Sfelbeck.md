## Description: 
This assignment involved creating tables and routes for the backend of an ecommerce site, much of the code was already provided so my task involved filling out the code on empty functions and models. 

## Usage:
In the integrated terminal you will need to run the schema in mysql followed by seeds/index.js and server.js in node, then I recommend Insomnia to test the routes.

## Installation: 
you will need to install sequelize, express, and mysql2 

## Testing:
same as use
